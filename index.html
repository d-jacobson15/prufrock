<!-- Annotations for each line -->
<div id="line1" style="display:none;">
    <p>Eliot opens the poem with an epigraph from Dante’s Inferno, where Guido da Montefeltro, condemned to the eighth circle of Hell, confesses his sins to Dante, confident that his words will remain unheard by the living. This allusion establishes a parallel between Prufrock’s self-confession and Guido’s: both are characters entrapped in their own personal Hells, articulating regrets they believe will never be judged or exposed to the outside world. The choice of this epigraph aligns Prufrock’s monologue with Dantean intertextuality, situating the poem within an existential framework where human frailty and moral entrapment are central themes. Eliot sets a tone of futility and nihilism, suggesting from the outset that Prufrock's reflections may ultimately be meaningless or unheard. The epigraph also introduces the concept of interiority of mind, establishing Prufrock as a neurotic, introspective character who is both the confessor and the confessed. The dedoublement of self (or "splitting of the self") is immediately suggested here: like Guido, Prufrock is trapped between his desire to articulate his inner anxieties and his awareness that this confession is, in some ways, futile.</p>
</div>
<div id="line2" style="display:none;">
    <p>Eliot opens the poem with an epigraph from Dante’s Inferno, where Guido da Montefeltro, condemned to the eighth circle of Hell, confesses his sins to Dante, confident that his words will remain unheard by the living. This allusion establishes a parallel between Prufrock’s self-confession and Guido’s: both are characters entrapped in their own personal Hells, articulating regrets they believe will never be judged or exposed to the outside world. The choice of this epigraph aligns Prufrock’s monologue with Dantean intertextuality, situating the poem within an existential framework where human frailty and moral entrapment are central themes.

</div>
<div id="line7" style="display:none;">
    <p>The phrase “Let us go” is an invitation, one that seems inclusive but is, in fact, solitary—the “you” may be the audience or an imagined interlocutor, yet it likely represents Prufrock’s own psyche. The line reflects monological rumination; Prufrock, unable to engage with others directly, fractures his self into two voices, creating a dialogue that exists solely within his own mind. The use of personal pronouns (“us,” “you,” “I”) here hints at dedoublement of self—Prufrock appears as both the guide and the guided, the observer and the participant, signaling an internal journey rather than an outward one. This line also subtly foreshadows the existential angst and epistemological disenfranchisement that will permeate the poem. The invitation to "go" suggests movement or purpose, but this is immediately undercut by the poem's structure and Prufrock's subsequent hesitations, revealing the emptiness of his journey. Eliot introduces the Modernist sense of fragmentation and disorientation here, as Prufrock's own self is not unified or directed.</p>
</div>
<div id="line8" style="display:none;">
    <p>Eliot employs pathetic fallacy here, using the image of the evening “spread out against the sky” to reflect Prufrock’s psychological state. The phrase suggests a passive, even vulnerable position, as if the evening itself is inert or vulnerable. This line initiates a shift from the inviting tone of “Let us go” to something more unsettling, as the world Prufrock describes is static, even oppressive, rather than dynamic or welcoming. Moreover, “spread out” implies a flattening or depletion, foreshadowing the decay and degradation that are recurrent motifs in the poem. The evening is a metaphor for Prufrock's inner desolation, reinforcing his sense of aimlessness and existential dread. This foreshadows his submission into decay, where his inner landscape is mirrored by the external world in a Modernist objective correlative.</p>
</div>
<div id="line9" style="display:none;">
    <p>This line introduces one of the poem’s most famous similes, comparing the evening to “a patient etherized upon a table.” Here, Eliot uses simile to evoke a sense of paralysis and anesthesia, immediately undercutting any romantic or lyrical expectation the reader may have had after the phrase “love song.” This image is jarring, contrasting sharply with traditional poetic comparisons of the evening to something beautiful or natural. Instead, Eliot portrays it as lifeless, helpless, and numb—qualities that reflect Prufrock’s own emotional and psychological stagnation. The simile also suggests bathos—a sudden drop from high to low imagery, which is characteristic of Eliot’s Modernist critique of romanticized perceptions of the world. The patient on the table is unable to move or act, a representation of Prufrock’s own passivity and inability to make decisions. This line also captures the futility of human life, as Prufrock’s journey begins under the shadow of incapacity and powerlessness, reflecting the disorientation and moral paralysis common in post-WWI literature.</p>
</div>
<div id="line10" style="display:none;">
    <p>Eliot’s repetition of “Let us go” reinforces Prufrock’s compulsion to keep moving despite his inertia. The phrase “certain half-deserted streets” introduces an urban setting that is simultaneously familiar and desolate. The choice of “half-deserted” conveys both isolation and ambivalence; these streets are neither entirely populated nor completely empty, suggesting a liminal space that mirrors Prufrock’s inner uncertainty. The juxtaposition of “certain” and “half-deserted” reflects Prufrock’s conflicted state of mind, caught between the known and the unknown. The “streets” become symbolic of Prufrock’s fragmented psyche—a maze of deserted pathways that lead nowhere, reflecting the Modernist theme of the decay of the social landscape. This line also aligns Prufrock with the archetype of the flaneur (a wandering observer of urban life), yet his observation is devoid of the pleasure or detachment associated with that figure, adding a tone of desolation and nihilism.</p>
</div>
<div id="line11" style="display:none;">
    <p>This line introduces an auditory image that conveys the sense of evasive, whispered conversations. The word “muttering” suggests secrecy, discontent, or even suppressed anger, capturing the social and psychological disquiet of the urban landscape that Prufrock inhabits. The “retreats” may represent both physical spaces—alleyways or corners of the city—and mental spaces, where one withdraws into themselves, perhaps hiding from moral confrontation. Eliot uses consonance in the repeated "t" sounds, giving the phrase a clipped, staccato quality that emphasizes Prufrock’s unease and hesitation. This sound echoes the rhythm of furtive footsteps or nervous whispers, evoking an atmosphere of tension and alienation. Furthermore, “retreats” functions as a double entendre, suggesting both physical spaces of withdrawal and the act of retreating from life, embodying Prufrock’s tendency to avoid direct engagement with others. Eliot’s use of pathetic fallacy aligns Prufrock’s fragmented psyche with the fragmented urban environment, reinforcing the disorientation and social decay of the Modernist era. The muttering retreats serve as a metaphor for Prufrock’s inner turmoil, representing his futile attempts to escape from his insecurities and existential dread.</p>
</div>
<div id="line12" style="display:none;">
    <p>Here, Eliot constructs an image of moral and emotional degradation through the mention of “one-night cheap hotels,” places associated with transience, superficial connections, and perhaps even prostitution. These “restless nights” speak to Prufrock’s insomnia and inner agitation, suggesting that he is haunted by his own inadequacies and unfulfilled desires. The internal rhyme between “night” and “right” gives the line a discordant musicality, reflecting the uncomfortable, half-conscious state of Prufrock’s mind. Eliot uses synecdoche in “one-night cheap hotels” to represent the impermanent and shallow relationships of modern urban life. This line portrays an urban reality where intimacy is fleeting and connections are void of depth, resonating with the disillusionment and fragmentation of Modernist sensibilities. Prufrock’s life is punctuated by these “restless nights,” reflecting his spiritual emptiness and inability to achieve meaningful human connection. The hotels themselves are metaphors for Prufrock’s psyche—a place where transient thoughts and desires pass through, but nothing substantial remains, reinforcing his sense of existential futility.</p>
</div>
<div id="line13" style="display:none;">
    <p>This line presents an image of poverty and decay within the cityscape. “Sawdust restaurants” refer to cheap establishments where sawdust would be spread on the floor to absorb spills and mask the dirt, creating an environment of impermanence and grit. The image of “oyster-shells” further adds to this sense of degradation; oysters, often seen as a delicacy, here appear only as discarded remnants, symbolizing both wasted potential and unfulfilled promise. Eliot juxtaposes the imagery of opulence (oysters) with that of poverty (sawdust) to reflect the decay of societal values and moral degradation in Prufrock’s world. This line also reinforces the theme of hypercivilisation—an urban space that is simultaneously overdeveloped and hollow, lacking authentic human connection or spiritual depth. The sawdust and oyster shells create a tactile, gritty quality that mirrors Prufrock’s own feelings of uncleanliness or inadequacy. The “restaurants” here are no places of nourishment but instead symbolize emotional and intellectual starvation, spaces where Prufrock’s isolation and inability to partake in genuine experience are laid bare.</p>
</div>
<div id="line14" style="display:none;">
    <p>Eliot employs a simile here to convey the drudgery and endlessness of Prufrock’s internal conflict. The phrase “tedious argument” suggests a relentless, circular debate that leads nowhere, mirroring Prufrock’s habit of second-guessing and self-doubt. The streets become emblematic of Prufrock’s mind—a labyrinth of indecision and self-critique where he is trapped by his own anxieties. By describing the streets as “following,” Eliot uses personification to make the urban landscape appear oppressive and unyielding, as if Prufrock is being stalked by his own thoughts. This simile also reflects Modernist themes of alienation and fragmentation; rather than offering clarity or direction, the streets (and, by extension, Prufrock’s mind) are convoluted and exhausting. The phrase “tedious argument” is deliberately mundane and anti-heroic, contributing to the poem’s bathos—a sense of anticlimax that undercuts any expectation of grandeur or resolution. Prufrock’s journey is thus marked by monotony rather than adventure, reinforcing the existential angst and futility of his life.</p>
</div>
<div id="line15" style="display:none;">
    <p>The phrase “insidious intent” introduces a sense of malice and danger lurking beneath the surface, though it remains ambiguous what that danger is. Eliot’s choice of “insidious” suggests something creeping, subtle, and corrupting, a quality that could apply to both the urban environment and Prufrock’s own psyche. This line personifies the streets as having a malevolent purpose, amplifying the existential dread and paranoia that characterize Prufrock’s internal monologue. The streets are not just tedious but actively “insidious,” indicating that Prufrock feels subtly threatened or undermined by his own surroundings and thoughts. The consonance of the “s” sounds in “insidious” and “streets” enhances the sinister undertone, giving the phrase a whispered quality that mirrors the secrecy and self-doubt infecting Prufrock’s mind. This line reflects the Modernist sense of moral decay and the fear that urban life itself is spiritually corrosive, an environment that facilitates Prufrock’s descent into internal turmoil and existential paralysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="line16" style="display:none;">
    <p>This line introduces the central motif of the “overwhelming question,” an undefined, existential dilemma that hangs over Prufrock’s mind but is never explicitly stated. The ellipsis at the end of the line creates an intentional pause, heightening the suspense and ambiguity around this question. This open-ended structure reflects the fragmented, uncertain nature of Prufrock’s psyche, his inability to articulate his fears or desires fully. The “overwhelming question” acts as an objective correlative for Prufrock’s existential crisis—a symbol of his inability to connect with others or find meaning in his life. This question embodies his fear of judgment, failure, and the deeper dread of his own purposelessness. By leaving the question unnamed, Eliot invites readers to project their interpretations, suggesting that the overwhelming nature of human existence itself is beyond words. This rhetorical device captures the Modernist disorientation where traditional meanings and values have decayed, leaving Prufrock—and, by extension, humanity—adrift in a world without clear answers or directions.</p>
</div>
<div id="line17" style="display:none;">
    <p>In this line, Prufrock pleads for avoidance, underscoring his deep fear of confrontation and introspection. The phrase “do not ask” is a form of apostrophe, addressing either the reader or an imagined companion and reinforcing the dramatic monologue structure. Prufrock’s refusal to define “it” reflects his own evasion and self-doubt; he fears probing too deeply into his own insecurities or existential concerns. The line implies that even Prufrock himself is unsure of what “it” is, or perhaps he fears the implications of facing it directly. Eliot’s use of direct address here gives the line an intimate, almost conspiratorial tone, as if Prufrock is confiding his anxieties but simultaneously barring any real exploration of them. This line captures Prufrock’s neuroticism and epistemological disenfranchisement—his inability to fully know or understand himself, let alone articulate it to others. The line also hints at the nihilistic undertone of the poem, suggesting that whatever “it” is, it might ultimately be meaningless, reinforcing Prufrock’s despair and his reluctance to engage with the overwhelming questions of life.</p>
</div>
<div id="line18" style="display:none;">
    <p>Returning to the phrase “Let us go,” Eliot reiterates the sense of motion, though it remains unclear where Prufrock is going or why. The vagueness of “make our visit” suggests a perfunctory or superficial engagement, a hollow gesture rather than a meaningful action. This line reflects Prufrock’s paralysis of will—he goes through the motions of action but lacks true intention or purpose. The phrase implies that the visit is merely a formality, reflecting Prufrock’s disconnection from any authentic human experience. The monological rumination becomes apparent as Prufrock once again creates a pseudo-dialogue within himself, reinforcing the dedoublement of self. This line, like the poem as a whole, captures the banality and futility of modern life, where actions are stripped of genuine significance. Prufrock’s journey is not one of self-discovery or transformation but rather a resigned drift through an empty, ritualised existence.</p>
</div>
<div id="line19" style="display:none;">
    <p>This refrain is one of the most enigmatic yet powerful images in the poem, repeated to reinforce Prufrock’s sense of alienation and inadequacy. The women are depicted as moving in a continuous, indifferent flow—"come and go"—suggesting a lack of genuine engagement or connection. The polysyndeton of “and” conveys a monotonous rhythm, enhancing the sense that their presence is mechanical, repetitive, and devoid of warmth or intimacy. The mention of “Michelangelo” is laden with irony; Michelangelo, the Renaissance master, represents the pinnacle of human achievement, physicality, and artistic perfection, ideals that stand in stark contrast to Prufrock’s insecurities and mediocrity. This cultural allusion highlights Prufrock’s feeling of inferiority—he sees himself as a failure, insignificant compared to these towering artistic icons that are casually referenced by others. Furthermore, Eliot’s use of historical allusion juxtaposes the grandeur of Michelangelo’s world with Prufrock’s own sense of smallness and paralysis, reinforcing the Modernist theme of hypercivilisation: a society increasingly divorced from genuine human connection, preoccupied instead with superficial, intellectual topics. The repetition of this line throughout the poem emphasises Prufrock’s sense of entrapment within his private hell, where he observes life passively, disconnected and unable to participate meaningfully.

</p>
</div>
<div id="line21" style="display:none;">
    <p>This line introduces a striking image of the “yellow fog,” personified with feline qualities as it “rubs its back upon the window-panes.” The personification and anthropomorphic imagery liken the fog to a cat, emphasising its stealthy, almost predatory nature. The colour “yellow” holds symbolic weight, often associated with decay, sickness, cowardice, or urban pollution, reflecting Prufrock’s tainted worldview and sense of moral degradation within the cityscape. The fog serves as a metaphor for Prufrock’s mind—clouded, murky, and obscured by existential dread. This imagery is emblematic of Modernist disorientation and urban decay; rather than a scene of pastoral beauty, the urban landscape here is insidious and smothering. The fog’s actions, “rubbing its back” on the windows, create a sense of intimacy but in a distorted way, as though Prufrock’s environment is closing in on him, further isolating him from the world beyond. Eliot’s choice to use the objective correlative here—linking the fog’s oppressive presence to Prufrock’s internal state—illustrates the fragmentation and disillusionment of the modern psyche, a key theme in Eliot’s work.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line22" style="display:none;">
    <p>Eliot repeats the colour “yellow” and the action of “rubbing,” but this time refers to it as “smoke” rather than “fog,” subtly altering the image. This repetition with variation creates a sense of continuity and entrapment, as though Prufrock is unable to escape his environment or his own thoughts. “Smoke” here implies something more corrosive and dangerous than fog, suggesting a creeping toxicity that further mirrors Prufrock’s internal decay. The phrase “rubs its muzzle” extends the animalistic imagery, enhancing the sense of an invasive, suffocating presence. The “window-panes” act as a transparent barrier, symbolising the distance between Prufrock and the external world; he is a passive observer, disconnected and isolated, trapped within his own mental landscape. This line reinforces the Dantean intertextuality of the poem, echoing images of purgatorial entrapment where Prufrock’s mind is both his prison and his punishment. The smoke’s slow, deliberate movement suggests a sense of creeping dread, capturing Prufrock’s existential paralysis in the face of a world he feels powerless to engage with or change.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line23" style="display:none;">
    <p>The line further extends the personification of the fog/smoke, now described as “licking its tongue into the corners of the evening.” The tactile, almost predatory action of “licking” gives the fog an unsettling, invasive quality, suggesting a slow, insidious encroachment on Prufrock’s world. The “corners of the evening” implies a creeping darkness or corruption, reinforcing the poem’s themes of moral decay and urban malaise. By focusing on “corners,” Eliot emphasises the marginalised and hidden aspects of life that Prufrock seems fixated upon—spaces of avoidance and retreat, rather than direct engagement. The synecdoche of “tongue” gives the fog a menacing corporeality, as if it is a living entity consuming the edges of Prufrock’s consciousness. This line heightens the interiority of mind present throughout the poem, illustrating how Prufrock’s anxieties are not simply psychological but have permeated his perception of the physical world around him, reflecting the Modernist theme of subjective reality.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line24" style="display:none;">
    <p>In this line, Eliot’s description of the fog “lingering upon the pools that stand in drains” evokes a sense of stagnation and decay. The image of “pools” in “drains” suggests something trapped, a waste that has nowhere to go, mirroring Prufrock’s own feelings of entrapment and futility. The fog lingers, refusing to dissipate, much like Prufrock’s inescapable introspection and existential dread. The use of enjambment from the previous line to this one slows the pace, enhancing the sense of lethargy and decay. These “pools” are stagnant and tainted, symbolising the intellectual and emotional wasteland of Prufrock’s psyche. Eliot’s choice of this mundane, grimy image—a pool in a drain—reinforces the anti-romantic and nihilistic tone of the poem, as Prufrock’s world is one where beauty has been drained away, leaving only remnants of waste and decay. This line encapsulates the despair of Modernist literature, where the urban environment itself becomes a mirror of the fractured human soul, offering no solace or renewal.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line25" style="display:none;">
    <p>Here, Eliot continues the imagery of pollution and urban grime, with the fog letting “fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys.” The repetition of “fall” creates a downward motion, symbolising decline and degradation, as if the city itself is collapsing under the weight of its own waste. “Soot” is a byproduct of industrialisation, and its presence here reinforces the Modernist critique of hypercivilisation—where urban advancement has led not to human flourishing but to spiritual and environmental decay. This line connects Prufrock’s internal state with the polluted, desolate landscape of the city, highlighting his sense of moral and existential entrapment. The “chimneys” evoke images of Victorian industry and modern alienation, a world driven by mechanical productivity but devoid of warmth or humanity. By describing the soot as falling upon the fog’s “back,” Eliot reinforces the personification of the fog as a burdened creature, weighed down by the detritus of modern life. The objective correlative here emphasises Prufrock’s psychological burden, suggesting that he, too, is weighed down by the soot of his own failures and unresolved existential questions.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line26" style="display:none;">
    <p>In this line, the fog is described as “slipping” by the terrace and making “a sudden leap.” The verb “slipped” conveys a sense of stealth and elusiveness, as if the fog, like Prufrock’s anxieties, is always just beyond grasp. The sudden “leap” contrasts with the previous lethargic movement, suggesting a brief moment of unpredictability or impulsiveness, a burst of energy that quickly dissipates. This juxtaposition between slow and sudden movement reflects Prufrock’s own fluctuations between paralysis and fleeting urges to take action. However, like the fog, he lacks the resolve to sustain any purposeful movement, highlighting his existential paralysis. The terrace represents a liminal space, a boundary between the interior and exterior world, mirroring Prufrock’s own threshold between inaction and engagement. The fog’s leap is ultimately meaningless, as it continues to drift aimlessly, reinforcing the futility of human endeavour in a Modernist context where action lacks direction or consequence.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line27" style="display:none;">
    <p>Eliot uses this line to momentarily situate the reader within a specific time and season: an “October night.” The choice of “October” is significant, as it evokes autumn, a time associated with decline, ageing, and the passage towards winter—symbolising Prufrock’s own sense of approaching irrelevance and decay. Describing the night as “soft” adds a layer of irony; though the word suggests gentleness or peace, it is undercut by the context of urban grime and Prufrock’s inner turmoil. This softness is not comforting but enervating, an atmosphere that lulls Prufrock into further inaction. The line reflects the pathos of Modernist literature, where even natural beauty is tinged with a sense of futility and decline. The “soft October night” thus becomes a metaphor for Prufrock’s own diminishing vitality, his life slipping quietly into obscurity without achieving fulfilment or connection.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line28" style="display:none;">
    <p>In this line, the fog is described as “curling” around the house and then “falling asleep,” reinforcing the eerie, feline imagery from earlier lines. The verb “curled” suggests a gentle, almost comforting movement, yet here it becomes unsettling, as if the fog is smothering or engulfing the world around Prufrock in its lethargy. This final act of the fog “falling asleep” signifies a complete descent into stasis and inactivity, mirroring Prufrock’s own existential paralysis. The fog, a metaphor for Prufrock’s own indecision and self-doubt, has reached a point of dormancy, symbolising Prufrock’s submission to his own fears and anxieties. Eliot’s choice of imagery here aligns with the Modernist theme of disillusionment; there is no hope for awakening or renewal, only the gentle acceptance of decay. By personifying the fog as something that can “fall asleep,” Eliot extends the objective correlative, showing how Prufrock’s emotional exhaustion has paralysed his ability to act or connect meaningfully with the world. This final image of the fog at rest underscores the poem’s sense of nihilism, as even Prufrock’s environment succumbs to a state of inertia and hopelessness.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line29" style="display:none;">
    <p>The phrase “And indeed there will be time” introduces one of the poem’s central motifs: time. Eliot’s repetition of “there will be time” creates a sense of ironic reassurance; Prufrock is convincing himself that he can delay any decisive action, continually postponing his choices and responsibilities. The line echoes Ecclesiastes 3 (“To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven”), though Eliot’s use here is laden with irony, as Prufrock is not facing inevitable tasks but instead avoiding them. This line captures the existential angst of Modernism, where the certainty of traditional structures has crumbled, leaving individuals to grapple with the overwhelming freedom—and fear—of determining their own lives. Prufrock’s repeated invocation of time reveals his neurotic need for reassurance, as he vacillates between desire and dread. This fixation on time encapsulates his epistemological disenfranchisement; he knows that time is slipping away but remains paralysed by the illusion that there is always more. The irony here highlights Prufrock’s failure to engage with the present, choosing instead to exist in a perpetual limbo of unmade decisions.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line30" style="display:none;">
    <p>This line reprises the “yellow smoke” from earlier, now “sliding along the street.” The verb “slides” suggests a stealthy, smooth movement, reinforcing the idea of something insidious and pervasive. Eliot’s use of the colour “yellow” continues to symbolise decay, cowardice, and corruption, attributes that reflect Prufrock’s internal state. The smoke, sliding and seeping into every crevice, symbolises how Prufrock’s insecurities and fears permeate his perception of the world around him. The imagery of the smoke and fog represents a psychological fog that clouds Prufrock’s ability to see or think clearly, reinforcing the Modernist theme of urban alienation. This line contributes to the objective correlative of Prufrock’s paralysis, as the smoke embodies his aimless, passive state, moving without purpose or destination. Eliot’s repeated use of the fog and smoke as metaphors for Prufrock’s psyche illustrates the overwhelming nature of his existential dread, which he cannot escape or control.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line31" style="display:none;">
    <p>Eliot repeats the action of “rubbing its back upon the window-panes,” maintaining the fog’s personified, feline quality. This image reinforces the sense of something both intrusive and intimate, as if the fog is persistently pressing up against the barriers between Prufrock and the outside world. The repetition of this phrase underscores Prufrock’s isolation; he is an observer, separated from life by a transparent barrier, trapped within his own mind. The “window-panes” serve as a metaphor for the fragile divide between Prufrock’s inner world and the exterior reality he is too fearful to confront. The fog’s insistent presence reflects Prufrock’s persistent thoughts of inadequacy and failure, which he cannot escape. This image encapsulates the psychological claustrophobia of Prufrock’s existence—his environment and mind are closing in on him, reinforcing the Modernist theme of internal conflict and fragmentation.

    <p>This repetition of “there will be time” further emphasises Prufrock’s habitual procrastination. The mantra-like quality of the phrase suggests that Prufrock is attempting to soothe himself with the illusion of endless time, even as he is acutely aware of its passage. The incantatory refrain of “there will be time” mirrors Prufrock’s own psychological self-soothing, a denial mechanism that allows him to avoid making any meaningful choices or facing uncomfortable truths. This line reflects the existential paralysis characteristic of Modernist protagonists, who are trapped in endless cycles of doubt and hesitation. Eliot’s repetition of this phrase throughout the poem heightens the sense of futility and stasis, as Prufrock convinces himself that he can delay action indefinitely, despite his growing awareness that he is wasting his life. This fixation on time becomes a metaphor for Prufrock’s inability to commit, highlighting his fear of both the future and the present.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line33" style="display:none;">
    <p>Eliot’s phrase “to prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet” encapsulates Prufrock’s preoccupation with social façades and his inability to engage authentically with others. The synecdoche of “face” represents Prufrock’s identity, which he views as a mere mask to be adjusted depending on the social situation. This line reflects the depersonalisation and fragmentation of identity common in Modernist literature, where individuals feel compelled to adapt to various roles, losing any true sense of self in the process. The repetitive structure of “face” and “faces” creates a mirror effect, suggesting that Prufrock sees himself reflected in the expectations of others rather than possessing any intrinsic identity. Eliot’s use of this line as an objective correlative symbolises the artificiality and superficiality of social interactions, highlighting Prufrock’s deep-seated fear of vulnerability and rejection. This line captures the Modernist sense of alienation and isolation within a hypercivilised world where authenticity is sacrificed for the maintenance of social decorum.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line34" style="display:none;">
    <p>In this line, Eliot juxtaposes “murder” and “create,” capturing the extremes of action and the potential for transformation within Prufrock’s psyche. The choice of such dramatic verbs suggests an existential yearning for change, though Prufrock remains paralysed by indecision. “Murder” can symbolise the annihilation of his current, ineffective self, while “create” hints at the possibility of reinventing himself, of breaking free from his psychological stasis. However, the phrase “there will be time” undercuts this potential, as Prufrock remains unwilling to take decisive action, delaying any transformation to an indefinite future. This line reflects the Modernist ambivalence towards identity and purpose; Prufrock’s desire for self-reinvention is tempered by his fear of the unknown and his reluctance to disrupt the status quo. Eliot’s choice of the verbs “murder” and “create” illustrates the existential conflict between destruction and creation, both within Prufrock and within humanity at large, encapsulating the tension between the desire for change and the dread of its consequences.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line35" style="display:none;">
    <p>This line alludes to Hesiod’s Works and Days, an ancient didactic poem about the struggles of human life, suggesting that Prufrock sees himself as part of a larger, futile cycle of mundane tasks and routines. The phrase “works and days of hands” invokes the physical, repetitive labour that defines human existence, especially within the context of urban modernity where life is reduced to monotonous, mechanical actions. The synecdoche of “hands” represents humanity’s detachment from meaning, as individuals are reduced to their functions rather than their identities. This line encapsulates Prufrock’s sense of being trapped in a meaningless cycle, where his actions hold no intrinsic value. Eliot’s use of this allusion highlights the futility and alienation of modern existence, as Prufrock’s life, like those in Hesiod’s poem, consists of routine tasks that serve no higher purpose. This line reflects the existential exhaustion of a society where individuals are alienated from their labour and from themselves, a key theme in Modernist literature.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line36" style="display:none;">
    <p>Eliot’s imagery of “lifting and dropping a question on your plate” captures the fleeting and superficial engagement with life’s deeper questions. The verb choice here—“lift and drop”—implies a lack of genuine interest or investment, as if existential concerns are treated as trivialities. The “plate” suggests a setting of social dining, where conversations are light and insubstantial, mirroring Prufrock’s own inability to confront his overwhelming questions directly. This line reflects the ennui and detachment that characterise Prufrock’s worldview, as he passively observes life’s questions being “dropped” in front of him, only to be dismissed or ignored. Eliot uses this image to highlight Prufrock’s existential avoidance; rather than engage meaningfully with the “question,” he allows it to be handled as casually as a morsel of food. This line captures the fragmentation of identity and purpose in Modernist society, where individuals confront profound questions only to let them slip away in the flow of trivial distractions.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line37" style="display:none;">
    <p>The repetition of “time” reinforces Prufrock’s fixation on delaying action and emphasises the gulf between “you” and “me,” suggesting a disconnection between himself and others. This line implies that Prufrock views time as something that separates rather than unites him with others, reinforcing his sense of isolation. The phrase “time for you and time for me” is paradoxically both inclusive and isolating; it suggests shared experience but also distinct, separate timelines that prevent real connection. Eliot’s use of parallel structure here reflects Prufrock’s fragmented self, as he struggles to reconcile his internal world with the external expectations of society. This line encapsulates the Modernist theme of alienation, where time becomes a barrier to intimacy, a medium through which Prufrock can never truly connect with others. His repeated assertion that there is “time” serves as a hollow reassurance, a means of coping with the reality that he is drifting further from meaningful human interaction.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line38" style="display:none;">
    <p>The phrase “a hundred indecisions” captures Prufrock’s paralysing habit of self-doubt, where each potential action is met with endless hesitation. The hyperbolic “hundred” amplifies his neurotic tendency to overthink, suggesting that he is constantly trapped in cycles of ambivalence and fear. Eliot’s choice of “indecisions” instead of “decisions” emphasises Prufrock’s inability to act; rather than make concrete choices, he remains suspended in a state of perpetual hesitation. This line captures the existential paralysis central to Modernist literature, where the fragmented self is unable to navigate the complexities of modern life without crumbling under the weight of introspection. The accumulation of “indecisions” suggests an ever-growing pile of missed opportunities, underscoring Prufrock’s sense of failure and futility. Eliot’s objective correlative here illustrates Prufrock’s inability to break free from his own mind, as the “hundred indecisions” are not simply choices he has failed to make but a testament to his chronic fear of action and engagement with life.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line39" style="display:none;">
    <p>Eliot’s repetition of “hundred” in this line maintains the sense of hyperbole, but here it applies to “visions and revisions,” highlighting Prufrock’s obsessive need to re-evaluate and second-guess his own thoughts. “Visions” suggests ideals, dreams, or plans that Prufrock forms in his mind, but each one is met with a “revision,” an alteration or withdrawal that prevents any idea from fully materialising. The phrase reflects Prufrock’s dedoublement of self, as he constantly splits himself into multiple perspectives, revising his own intentions before they can take shape. This fixation on revision mirrors the fragmented consciousness of the Modernist psyche, where certainty is elusive and every potential path is riddled with doubt. Eliot uses the structure of “visions and revisions” as a metaphor for Prufrock’s psychological instability; rather than moving forward, he loops endlessly within his own mind, eroding his ability to engage with the real world. This line underscores the futility and ennui that pervade Prufrock’s existence, as every “vision” is tempered by hesitation, leaving him in a perpetual state of inaction.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line40" style="display:none;">
    <p>Eliot’s image of “toast and tea” is deliberately mundane, evoking the triviality of social rituals that contrast sharply with the grandiosity of “visions and revisions.” By juxtaposing Prufrock’s grand existential angst with the banality of afternoon tea, Eliot emphasises the bathos in Prufrock’s psyche—a descent from potential greatness to the trivialities of daily life. This line highlights Prufrock’s fear that his profound internal struggles will ultimately be meaningless, reduced to nothing more than a minor diversion before social niceties. The phrase “before the taking” suggests that all these “indecisions” and “revisions” are exercises in avoidance, ways for Prufrock to postpone genuine engagement or action. The everyday act of taking tea becomes symbolic of his paralysis of will; rather than confronting his fears, he retreats into familiar routines that offer a false sense of security. Eliot’s use of such a banal activity as the culmination of Prufrock’s inner turmoil underscores the absurdity and futility of his existential struggles within the structure of a modern, hypercivilised society.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line41" style="display:none;">
    <p>This refrain returns, reinforcing the disconnect between Prufrock’s inner turmoil and the indifferent, repetitive world around him. The women, “coming and going,” continue their superficial conversation about Michelangelo, symbolising the unattainable world of art, beauty, and cultural accomplishment that Prufrock feels excluded from. Eliot’s use of this refrain serves as an incantatory device, echoing like a recurring thought in Prufrock’s mind, emphasising his alienation from others. The line’s repetition implies a cyclical, unchanging world, where these women remain impervious to Prufrock’s existential struggles, reinforcing his feeling of social isolation. The women’s casual mention of Michelangelo heightens Prufrock’s sense of inadequacy, as he is surrounded by people who seem to understand or appreciate greatness in ways he cannot. This line epitomises Prufrock’s neurotic self-consciousness, as he is hyper-aware of how out of place he feels among people who appear confident and socially adept. The refrain reinforces the theme of fragmented identity, as Prufrock feels cut off not only from these women but from the ideals they represent.

</p>
</div>
<div id="line43" style="display:none;">
    <p>Eliot’s repetition of “there will be time” takes on an almost hypnotic quality here, as if Prufrock is trying to convince himself of the comfort that time provides. This mantra of reassurance serves as a form of self-deception, as Prufrock delays action with the belief that there will always be another opportunity. The incantatory refrain reinforces Prufrock’s existential paralysis, as he clings to the illusion of infinite time to avoid confronting his fears. This line is steeped in irony, as the reader recognises that time is, in fact, running out for Prufrock, and his constant deferral only deepens his sense of alienation. Eliot’s repetition of this phrase throughout the poem captures the nihilistic undertones of Modernist literature, where the notion of “time” becomes both a comfort and a trap, lulling Prufrock into inaction even as he senses the futility of his existence.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line44" style="display:none;">
    <p>The repeated question “Do I dare?” encapsulates Prufrock’s profound insecurity and his fear of judgment, as he second-guesses even the smallest actions. The repetition of this question underscores his chronic self-doubt, reflecting the internal colloquy that defines his fragmented consciousness. The line’s rhetorical nature reveals Prufrock’s inability to reach any definitive answer, leaving him in a state of perpetual hesitation. The simplicity of the question contrasts with its existential weight; in asking “Do I dare?” Prufrock is really questioning his entire identity and purpose. This line is a microcosm of his existential angst, as he is paralysed not by specific obstacles but by his own lack of confidence. Eliot uses the repetition of “Do I dare?” to illustrate the epistemological crisis of the modern self, where every choice is met with crippling self-consciousness and doubt. This line captures the Modernist theme of the isolated individual, trapped within an endless loop of introspection that prevents authentic engagement with the world.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line45" style="display:none;">
    <p>This line suggests Prufrock’s inclination to retreat from life, to “turn back” rather than confront the challenges before him. The imagery of “descending the stair” is loaded with symbolism, evoking a sense of descent, defeat, and regression. To descend is to go backward, both literally and metaphorically, representing Prufrock’s unwillingness to move forward in his life or in his interactions with others. This retreat down the stairs reflects his desire to withdraw into the safety of solitude, away from the judgment and expectations of the world. Eliot’s use of this image reinforces Prufrock’s paralysis of will; he is a man perpetually in retreat, evading the risks of self-exposure. This line captures the Modernist preoccupation with failure and self-doubt, as Prufrock’s life becomes a series of avoided encounters and missed opportunities. The image of descending the stair suggests a resignation to mediocrity, a retreat into the shadows rather than a bold step into the light of self-assertion.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line46" style="display:none;">
    <p>This line reveals Prufrock’s acute self-consciousness about his physical appearance, a reflection of his deeper insecurities and fear of judgment. The “bald spot” symbolises his awareness of ageing and decline, intensifying his feelings of inadequacy in a society that values youth and vitality. By focusing on this seemingly trivial physical detail, Eliot captures Prufrock’s obsessive self-scrutiny and the neuroticism that pervades his thoughts. The bald spot becomes a metaphor for his perceived failures and limitations, reinforcing his sense of inferiority. This line exemplifies the Modernist theme of personal fragility and self-doubt, as Prufrock fixates on his imperfections rather than his potential. Eliot’s choice to have Prufrock dwell on his appearance reflects the superficial values of the modern world, where self-worth is often measured by external qualities. Prufrock’s bald spot becomes emblematic of his belief that he is unworthy of love or admiration, adding to his pervasive sense of social isolation.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line47" style="display:none;">
    <p>Here, Prufrock imagines the judgment of others, projecting his own insecurities onto an imagined audience. The parenthetical structure isolates this line, creating the sense that this thought is a private, whispered fear that intrudes upon his consciousness. This self-critique reveals Prufrock’s crippling self-consciousness and his belief that others are constantly scrutinising his flaws. The imagined voices echo his own inner doubts, creating a sense of dedoublement of self, where Prufrock perceives himself through the eyes of others, further fragmenting his identity. Eliot uses this imagined judgment to illustrate the alienation and paranoia that define Prufrock’s existence, as he is haunted by the idea that he is being constantly evaluated and found lacking. The phrase “How his hair is growing thin!” underscores Prufrock’s fear of ageing and irrelevance, as he fixates on a detail that symbolises his perceived obsolescence. This line captures the Modernist theme of self-alienation, where individuals internalise the judgments of society, leading to a fractured and insecure self-image.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line48" style="display:none;">
    <p>Prufrock’s description of his attire, specifically his “morning coat” and high collar, conveys an image of formality and restraint. The “collar mounting firmly to the chin” suggests a rigid, almost stifling propriety, as if Prufrock’s clothes are symbols of his confinement within social conventions. The meticulous detail with which he describes his appearance reflects his acute awareness of the need to conform, yet it also reveals his discomfort within these constraints. Eliot’s use of metonymy here positions Prufrock’s clothes as an extension of his persona, highlighting his discomfort with his own identity. The high collar symbolises the barriers he erects between himself and others, both physically and emotionally. This line illustrates the Modernist critique of social facades, as Prufrock’s attire represents the artifice he uses to shield himself from genuine connection. His “morning coat” is not just a garment but a mask, reinforcing his fragmented identity and his inability to reveal his true self.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line49" style="display:none;">
    <p>Prufrock’s description of his necktie as “rich and modest” captures his paradoxical desire to stand out while remaining unobtrusive. The “simple pin” that asserts it symbolises his effort to balance self-expression with social decorum, hinting at his internal conflict between individuality and conformity. This meticulous attention to his appearance reflects Prufrock’s anxiety about how he is perceived by others, highlighting his neurotic preoccupation with his outward presentation. The necktie serves as a metaphor for Prufrock’s conflicted identity, where he is torn between self-assertion and self-effacement. Eliot’s choice of words—“rich,” “modest,” and “simple”—suggests Prufrock’s struggle to embody conflicting values, illustrating the fragmentation that characterises his sense of self. This line reflects the Modernist theme of social facades and the internal dissonance that arises from trying to fit into societal expectations. Prufrock’s fixation on his necktie illustrates his inability to transcend the superficial concerns that prevent him from engaging with life on a deeper level.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line50" style="display:none;">
    <p>This line again plunges us into Prufrock’s neurotic interiority, capturing his acute fear of social judgment. The parentheses create a layer of isolation around this thought, as though it’s a whisper or aside that Prufrock is reluctant to fully confront. Imagining others criticising his “thin” arms and legs, Prufrock projects his own self-consciousness onto an imagined audience. This imagined criticism reflects his fear of inadequacy, particularly in physical and social terms. The focus on his body’s thinness symbolises his sense of weakness and vulnerability, both physical and emotional. By fixating on his perceived flaws, Prufrock reveals his internalised sense of inferiority and lack of vitality. Eliot uses this line to illustrate dedoublement of self; Prufrock experiences himself through the eyes of others, fragmenting his identity and deepening his alienation. The line captures the Modernist preoccupation with self-alienation and the way social expectations amplify personal insecurities. Prufrock’s imagined critics represent the societal pressures that exacerbate his paralysis, reinforcing his belief that he is fundamentally flawed and unworthy of admiration.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line51" style="display:none;">
    <p>This short question, repeated from earlier, functions as a recurring mantra in Prufrock’s mind, embodying his constant self-doubt. The stark simplicity of “Do I dare” captures the magnitude of Prufrock’s inner conflict; he cannot even bring himself to finish the question, as though the act of daring itself is unthinkable. This fragmentary structure reflects his fragmented psyche, emphasising his inability to act with certainty or confidence. Eliot uses this line as an objective correlative for Prufrock’s existential paralysis, as his constant questioning becomes a barrier to action. The unresolved nature of the question mirrors his fear of risk and failure, highlighting the nihilistic undertone of the poem, where potential decisions remain forever unfulfilled. This line reflects the Modernist exploration of interiority, where characters grapple with existential crises and self-doubt, often without reaching resolution. For Prufrock, the question “Do I dare” becomes emblematic of his larger struggle with identity and purpose, as he repeatedly avoids facing his own fears.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line52" style="display:none;">
    <p>In this line, Prufrock’s question gains a cosmic dimension; the idea of “disturbing the universe” elevates his fears to an almost absurd level. By questioning whether he should disturb the universe, Prufrock’s hesitation is rendered paradoxically grandiose and trivial. The phrase reflects the bathos in Prufrock’s character, as his minor decisions—whether to speak, act, or express himself—are inflated to cosmic proportions in his mind, highlighting his overwhelming self-consciousness. Eliot uses this line to critique the hypercivilised, self-obsessed nature of the modern psyche, where even small actions are perceived as monumental and potentially disruptive. This question illustrates Prufrock’s existential anxiety; he feels that any attempt to assert himself will be not only inadequate but somehow catastrophically consequential. The phrase “disturb the universe” encapsulates the Modernist sense of fragmentation and the alienation of individuals who feel disconnected from any larger purpose. For Prufrock, to act is to risk rejection, failure, and ultimately, a collapse of the fragile universe he has constructed within his mind.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line53" style="display:none;">
    <p>Prufrock’s fixation on time continues here with the phrase “in a minute there is time,” implying his reliance on the notion that brief, fleeting moments hold infinite potential. This line embodies his procrastination, suggesting that he repeatedly postpones action by convincing himself there will always be more time. The phrase serves as a form of self-deception, a reassurance that allows him to avoid making definitive choices. Eliot’s use of pararhyme between “minute” and “time” creates a subtle dissonance, reflecting Prufrock’s fragmented thoughts and his inability to grasp a sense of permanence. This line highlights the epistemological crisis at the heart of Modernist literature, where the certainty of time becomes illusory, and individuals struggle with the fleeting nature of existence. Prufrock’s reliance on “a minute” as a measure of time suggests his belief in small, incremental postponements, yet these add up to a lifetime of inaction. This line encapsulates the futility of human life as Prufrock continues to defer action, convincing himself that each passing moment offers another chance that he ultimately fails to seize.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line54" style="display:none;">
    <p>Eliot’s phrasing here, “decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse,” highlights Prufrock’s inability to commit to any course of action, as each decision is swiftly followed by a reversal. The rhyming structure of “decisions” and “revisions” reinforces the circularity and stasis in Prufrock’s thoughts, capturing the way he continually undermines himself. This line reflects his dedoublement of self, where every thought or choice is met with an immediate counter-thought or reconsideration, leading to a paralysis of will. Eliot’s use of the word “minute” here is significant; it suggests the triviality and impermanence of his choices, as though they are insignificant enough to be revised within seconds. This pattern of indecision illustrates the existential dread that permeates Prufrock’s life, as he becomes trapped in a loop of aborted choices. The phrase “a minute will reverse” conveys the Modernist theme of fragmentation, where even the smallest unit of time becomes a site of self-doubt and hesitation. Prufrock’s indecisiveness becomes emblematic of the futility of human agency in a world where certainty and permanence are elusive.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line55" style="display:none;">
    <p>The phrase “I have known them all already, known them all” introduces a sense of weariness and resignation. Prufrock’s repetition of “known them all” suggests a jaded outlook, as though he believes there is nothing new or meaningful left to experience. This anaphora reflects his disillusionment with life and social interaction, implying that he sees all people and situations as repetitive and predictable. By claiming to have “known them all,” Prufrock distances himself from others, reinforcing his sense of alienation and superiority. This line captures the ennui that defines Prufrock’s existence; he is emotionally and intellectually exhausted, feeling that his life is a series of shallow, meaningless encounters. Eliot uses this line to illustrate the Modernist theme of existential emptiness, where characters struggle to find purpose in a world stripped of significance. Prufrock’s assertion that he has “known them all” reveals his reluctance to engage with others on a deeper level, as he pre-emptively dismisses any possibility of connection.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line56" style="display:none;">
    <p>Eliot’s repetition of “known” in this line continues Prufrock’s sense of world-weariness, expanding his ennui to encompass time itself. By listing “evenings, mornings, afternoons,” Prufrock suggests that each day is monotonous and interchangeable, further illustrating his sense of life’s futility. This line reflects the temporal fragmentation characteristic of Modernist literature, where time is no longer linear or progressive but instead a series of repetitive cycles that lack meaning. Eliot’s use of polysyndeton with “and” emphasises the relentless continuity of time, which, rather than providing opportunities for growth or change, only reinforces Prufrock’s sense of stagnation. The lack of distinction between parts of the day symbolises Prufrock’s existential exhaustion, as if every hour is equally void of significance. This line encapsulates the futility of routine in Prufrock’s life; rather than offering comfort, the predictability of time becomes a source of despair, reinforcing his sense that life is nothing but a series of empty moments.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line57" style="display:none;">
    <p>One of the most iconic lines in the poem, “I have measured out my life with coffee spoons” captures Prufrock’s acute sense of triviality and insignificance. The synecdoche of “coffee spoons” represents the small, inconsequential actions that make up his existence, suggesting that his life has been reduced to mundane, repetitive gestures. This line conveys a profound sense of bathos, as Prufrock’s life, instead of being marked by grand achievements or meaningful experiences, is measured by something as trivial as coffee spoons. Eliot’s use of this metaphor highlights the alienation and despair that permeate Prufrock’s character; he feels that he has wasted his life on minor, superficial rituals rather than pursuing any genuine fulfilment. This line exemplifies the Modernist critique of hypercivilisation, where even the act of measuring life is stripped of significance, leaving individuals adrift in a world of trivialities. Prufrock’s realisation that his life is defined by coffee spoons underscores the emptiness of his existence and his deep-seated sense of inadequacy.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line58" style="display:none;">
    <p>In this line, Prufrock’s description of “voices dying with a dying fall” reflects the fading, hollow nature of social interactions. The alliteration of “dying” and “dying fall” enhances the sense of exhaustion, capturing Prufrock’s disillusionment with conversations that lack substance or sincerity. The repetition of “dying” reinforces the theme of decay, as Prufrock’s social world is filled with people who speak without conviction, whose voices gradually fade into insignificance. This line captures the Modernist theme of disillusionment with traditional forms of communication, as Prufrock finds himself surrounded by empty words and insincere expressions. Eliot’s choice of words evokes the ephemeral quality of social connections in Prufrock’s world, where relationships are fleeting and devoid of depth. This line suggests that Prufrock perceives the voices around him as dying, symbolic of his perception that true communication is dead or impossible in a hypercivilised society.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line59" style="display:none;">
    <p>The phrase “beneath the music from a farther room” suggests a sense of distance and separation, as if Prufrock is perpetually on the outskirts of life, unable to fully participate. The “farther room” implies that the vibrancy and connection he longs for are always out of reach, reinforcing his sense of alienation. Eliot’s use of spatial imagery here reflects Prufrock’s isolation; he hears the music, yet it is distant, muffled, and inaccessible, symbolising his inability to connect with the life and passion he observes around him. The line creates a sense of melancholic longing, as Prufrock is drawn to the music but remains unable to join it, highlighting the gulf between his internal world and the world outside. This image encapsulates the Modernist theme of fragmentation; Prufrock is both physically and emotionally distanced from others, trapped within the confines of his mind. The “farther room” serves as a metaphor for the unattainable social fulfilment he desires, underscoring the futility of his existence and his profound sense of isolation.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line60" style="display:none;">
    <p>Prufrock’s question, “So how should I presume?” reveals his persistent self-doubt and inability to assert himself. The word “presume” suggests overstepping boundaries or taking liberties, implying that Prufrock feels unworthy or unwelcome in situations that require confidence. The question also reveals his neurotic over-analysis, as he is paralysed by even the most basic decisions regarding how to interact with others. This line captures Prufrock’s existential insecurity; he is unsure of his place in the world and lacks the confidence to assert his desires or intentions. The rhetorical nature of the question reflects his dedoublement of self, as he both desires and fears engagement, simultaneously pushing himself forward and holding himself back. Eliot’s use of this line highlights the Modernist preoccupation with identity and self-worth, where characters are haunted by an intense awareness of their own limitations. For Prufrock, to “presume” is to risk judgment, failure, and rejection, and this fear stifles any attempt to connect meaningfully with others.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line61" style="display:none;">
    <p>Prufrock’s claim that he has “known the eyes already” emphasises his sense of disillusionment and detachment. The “eyes” serve as a synecdoche for people, reducing them to the act of looking or judging, and indicating Prufrock’s discomfort with being observed. The repetition of “known” underscores his belief that all social interactions are predictable and superficial, offering no genuine connection or novelty. This line encapsulates Prufrock’s alienation; he perceives others not as individuals with whom he could form a bond, but as judgmental eyes that evaluate and scrutinise him. Eliot’s choice to isolate “eyes” reflects the depersonalisation that pervades modern society, where people are reduced to their roles and appearances rather than recognised for their humanity. This line also reveals Prufrock’s paranoia; he is consumed by the idea that others see and judge him, which reinforces his sense of inadequacy. By claiming to have “known them all,” Prufrock distances himself from others, resigning himself to a life of detachment and isolation.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line62" style="display:none;">
    <p>This line intensifies Prufrock’s fear of judgment, as he imagines these “eyes” reducing him to a “formulated phrase”—a cliché or stereotype. The alliteration of “fix” and “formulated” creates a sense of rigidity and confinement, as if Prufrock is trapped in others’ expectations of him. The phrase “fix you” implies a hostile, almost predatory gaze that pins him down, echoing his sense of vulnerability and self-consciousness. Eliot’s use of “formulated phrase” highlights the dehumanising effect of social judgment; Prufrock feels that others perceive him in oversimplified, reductive terms, rather than as a complex individual. This line captures the Modernist theme of alienation, where individuals are confined within society’s expectations and deprived of authentic self-expression. Prufrock’s fear of being “fixed” in a phrase reflects his anxiety about identity, as he worries that his true self is obscured by the labels and judgments others place upon him. This line underscores Prufrock’s sense of powerlessness, as he feels objectified and defined by the gaze of others.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line63" style="display:none;">
    <p>Here, Prufrock extends the metaphor of judgment by comparing himself to an insect “sprawling on a pin.” This grotesque image of entrapment reflects his fear of being analysed, categorised, and ultimately diminished by society. The imagery of entomology conveys his sense of being exposed and dissected, as if he were an insect pinned in a display case for others to scrutinise. This line highlights Prufrock’s existential dread; he fears that his identity will be reduced to something static and lifeless, robbed of depth or complexity. Eliot’s use of “sprawling” emphasises his helplessness, as Prufrock feels paralysed and immobilised by others’ perceptions of him. The comparison to an insect also reflects his self-loathing and perception of inadequacy, as he views himself as insignificant and repulsive. This line captures the Modernist sense of alienation and fragmentation, where individuals feel reduced and objectified, unable to escape the gaze that confines them to narrow, reductive roles.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line64" style="display:none;">
    <p>This continuation of the insect metaphor reinforces Prufrock’s sense of entrapment and vulnerability. To be “pinned and wriggling on the wall” suggests both physical and psychological agony, as Prufrock feels exposed and powerless. The image of “wriggling” conveys his futile attempts to escape the judgment of others, reflecting his paralysis of will and inability to free himself from societal expectations. Eliot’s choice of imagery here captures Prufrock’s existential anxiety; he feels perpetually scrutinised and judged, stripped of autonomy and agency. The “wall” symbolises the barriers he perceives between himself and the rest of the world, reinforcing his sense of isolation. This line exemplifies the Modernist theme of alienation, as Prufrock is trapped not by physical forces but by the psychological weight of his own insecurities and societal pressures. The image of “wriggling” also reflects his fragmented identity, as he struggles to define himself in a world that views him as an object.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line65" style="display:none;">
    <p>Prufrock’s rhetorical question, “Then how should I begin,” reflects his paralysis and indecision, as he is overwhelmed by the prospect of articulating his thoughts or desires. The word “begin” suggests that he has not yet made any progress towards self-expression, highlighting his deep-seated fear of rejection and judgment. This line encapsulates his dedoublement of self, as he simultaneously wants to speak and yet cannot bring himself to start. Eliot uses this question to illustrate Prufrock’s existential angst; he is caught between his desire to be understood and his fear of exposing his vulnerabilities. The open-endedness of the question reflects the Modernist sense of fragmentation, as Prufrock’s thoughts are incomplete, lacking resolution or clarity. For Prufrock, “beginning” is an almost insurmountable obstacle, symbolising his struggle to find a sense of purpose or direction. This line captures the futility of his internal struggle, as he remains unable to take any meaningful action.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line66" style="display:none;">
    <p>The phrase “to spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways” conveys Prufrock’s disdain for his own life, reducing his experiences to discarded remnants. The “butt-ends” metaphor suggests that his life has been reduced to trivial, wasted fragments, as though he has only the leftovers of time and effort. The word “spit” implies an act of disgust or rejection, revealing Prufrock’s self-loathing and disillusionment with his own existence. Eliot’s choice of imagery here reflects the nihilism at the heart of Prufrock’s worldview; he sees his life as a series of meaningless actions and wasted opportunities. This line captures the Modernist critique of hypercivilisation, where individuals are alienated from any sense of genuine fulfilment, their lives reduced to routines and regrets. Prufrock’s desire to “spit out” these remnants symbolises his deep dissatisfaction, yet he remains trapped in this cycle of self-contempt. This line encapsulates his existential crisis, as he confronts the emptiness of his life without knowing how to escape it.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line67" style="display:none;">
    <p>This repetition of “how should I presume” reinforces Prufrock’s inability to assert himself or make decisions, as he remains trapped in a loop of self-doubt and hesitation. The word “presume” again suggests that Prufrock feels unworthy of even attempting to connect with others, as though any action on his part would be an unwelcome intrusion. This line highlights his epistemological disenfranchisement; he questions his right to take up space, to assert his presence, or to pursue his desires. The rhetorical nature of the question captures his existential paralysis, as he constantly questions his own worth and capabilities. Eliot uses this line to illustrate the Modernist theme of alienation, where characters are rendered passive and indecisive, unable to engage meaningfully with the world. Prufrock’s repeated questioning reveals the depth of his insecurity, as he is unable to overcome his fear of judgment long enough to make any genuine connection with others.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line68" style="display:none;">
    <p>In this line, Prufrock’s repeated use of “known” conveys his sense of jaded familiarity and detachment. The “arms” serve as another synecdoche, representing women or potential romantic partners, yet they are depersonalised and objectified in his mind. By reducing people to their arms, Prufrock reveals his inability to form genuine connections, seeing others only as fragmented parts rather than whole individuals. This line encapsulates Prufrock’s alienation from intimacy; he has experienced glimpses of closeness but remains fundamentally detached, as though no relationship could ever satisfy his need for connection. Eliot’s use of repetition reinforces Prufrock’s sense of world-weariness, as he feels he has “known them all” without ever truly engaging with any of them. This line highlights the Modernist theme of depersonalisation, where individuals are reduced to parts or stereotypes, stripping relationships of depth and authenticity. Prufrock’s assertion that he has “known them all” suggests a resignation to solitude, as he believes there is nothing left for him to discover or experience.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line69" style="display:none;">
    <p>Prufrock’s description of the “braceleted and white and bare” arms conveys an idealised but ultimately superficial image of femininity. The imagery of bracelets and bare skin suggests a seductive quality, yet the description remains distant and objectifying, reinforcing Prufrock’s inability to see women as complete, individual beings. By focusing on these physical details, Prufrock reduces women to aesthetic objects rather than recognising them as potential partners in meaningful relationships. Eliot’s choice of words here reflects the Modernist theme of hypercivilisation, where human relationships are reduced to surface-level attractions devoid of deeper connection. The emphasis on “white” implies purity or perfection, but also a sense of coldness or inaccessibility, suggesting that these women remain out of reach for Prufrock. This line captures his alienation from intimacy; he is attracted to these “arms” but is unable to bridge the gap between his own self-consciousness and genuine connection.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line70" style="display:none;">
    <p>In this parenthetical aside, Prufrock notes the “light brown hair” on the arms he describes, a seemingly trivial detail that reflects his obsessive focus on minutiae. The parenthesis creates a sense of internal colloquy, as if Prufrock is quietly musing to himself, revealing his fragmented thoughts and his fixation on specific, inconsequential details. This focus on the hair on the arms humanises the image slightly, introducing an element of realism that contrasts with his otherwise idealised descriptions. However, Prufrock’s fixation on such minor features reinforces his neurotic self-consciousness and inability to engage with others as wholes. Eliot’s use of this parenthesis exemplifies the Modernist theme of fragmentation, as Prufrock’s mind wanders and shifts focus without cohesion. The detail of the “light brown hair” serves to underscore his alienation, as he is unable to transcend his own perceptions and connect meaningfully with another person. For Prufrock, even the smallest details become sources of fixation, further inhibiting his ability to act or engage.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line71" style="display:none;">
    <p>Prufrock’s question about whether it is “perfume from a dress” that makes him digress reflects his susceptibility to sensory distractions and his inability to maintain focus. The perfume serves as a symbol of femininity and allure, but Prufrock’s response is one of distraction rather than attraction. The phrase “makes me so digress” reveals his lack of control over his own thoughts, as he is easily pulled away from any semblance of a cohesive purpose. Eliot’s use of this line highlights Prufrock’s existential fragmentation; he is constantly sidetracked by inconsequential details, revealing his inability to commit to any single thought or action. The perfume, representing allure and intimacy, ironically serves as an obstacle to connection, as Prufrock’s neurosis prevents him from pursuing any genuine relationship. This line encapsulates the Modernist preoccupation with alienation and introspection, as Prufrock’s self-consciousness inhibits him from engaging meaningfully with the world around him.

The phrase “makes me so digress” reveals his lack of control over his own thoughts, as he is easily pulled away from any semblance of a cohesive purpose.

</p>
</div>
<div id="line73" style="display:none;">
    <p>Here, Eliot’s visual imagery of “arms that lie along a table” suggests a sense of passivity and languor. The arms are positioned in a way that reflects inertia and detachment, symbolising Prufrock’s inability to imagine an active, engaged connection with others. By describing the arms as “wrap[ping] about a shawl,” Eliot conjures a sense of comfort or warmth, yet this warmth remains inaccessible to Prufrock; it is something he observes but cannot experience. The imagistic detail here serves as a visual metaphor for Prufrock’s detachment and emotional distance, as he fixates on the superficial rather than engaging with the person behind the gesture. The chiasmic quality of “lie” and “wrap” juxtaposes stasis with movement, reflecting Prufrock’s own oscillation between desire and inertia. This line underscores the epistemological solitude that defines Prufrock’s character; he reduces women to fragmented, static images, reinforcing his inability to comprehend them as holistic, complex beings. Through this image, Eliot captures Prufrock’s fractured worldview and his existential confinement within his own psyche, where others appear only as isolated parts, devoid of personal agency.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line74" style="display:none;">
    <p>[Prufrock’s recurring question, “should I presume?” epitomises his hesitancy and perpetual self-questioning. The word “presume” here carries connotations of audacity and risk, suggesting that Prufrock views even the simplest social engagement as fraught with danger. This line exemplifies existential ambivalence; he is caught between a desire to connect and a paralysing fear of overstepping boundaries. The repetition of this rhetorical question operates as an expression of ontological uncertainty, as Prufrock doubts his right to assert himself within the social sphere. This persistent refrain exposes his inwardly recursive thinking, where every inclination towards action is met with countering self-doubt, leading to a cycle of endless hesitation. Eliot uses Prufrock’s questioning as an index of internal dissonance, capturing the psychological state of a man alienated from both himself and society. This line illustrates Prufrock’s metaphysical insecurity, where every potential interaction becomes an insurmountable obstacle, reinforcing his isolation and estrangement from human connection.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line75" style="display:none;">
    <p>This line reveals Prufrock’s ongoing indecisiveness, highlighting his struggle to find a starting point for self-expression. The question “how should I begin” signifies not just a lack of confidence, but an absence of existential grounding; Prufrock lacks a fundamental sense of self from which to act or speak. This moment encapsulates existential diffidence, a state where he is aware of his inadequacy but lacks the means to overcome it. Eliot’s use of paraliptic inquiry—a question asked with no intention of finding an answer—captures Prufrock’s endless deferral of action. The line suggests that Prufrock’s inner world is not merely fragmented, but devoid of any cohesive direction or purpose. His inability to “begin” reflects his metaphysical stasis, as he is perpetually caught at the threshold of self-expression without the capacity to cross it. Eliot crafts this line to underscore the ontological inertia of Modernist protagonists, who are weighed down by their own introspection to the point of inaction.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line76" style="display:none;">
    <p>In this line, Prufrock contemplates how he might frame his life experiences in conversation, considering a statement that would situate him as a figure wandering “at dusk through narrow streets.” The “narrow streets” evoke images of isolation and confinement, hinting at Prufrock’s sense of entrapment within his own life. The time of “dusk” symbolises a liminal state, caught between day and night, reflecting Prufrock’s existential liminality—a state where he exists between action and inaction, presence and absence. Eliot’s use of synecdochic landscape transforms the urban environment into a reflection of Prufrock’s own psyche, where the winding, narrowing paths mirror his convoluted thought processes. This line captures the hermeneutic ambiguity of Prufrock’s character, as he struggles to ascribe meaning to his own experiences. By framing his life in such terms, Prufrock inadvertently reveals his sense of estrangement, as he moves through life not as a participant but as an observer, detached and unable to find a sense of direction or purpose.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line77" style="display:none;">
    <p>The image of “smoke that rises from the pipes” invokes a sense of monotony and repetitiveness, as though the act of watching smoke dissipate is all that fills Prufrock’s life. This line conveys existential vacuity; the smoke is transient, without substance, mirroring Prufrock’s own feeling of insignificance and his life’s lack of direction. The smoke serves as a leitmotif for impermanence and disintegration, echoing Prufrock’s anxiety about his ephemeral existence. Eliot’s use of subdued symbolism here portrays Prufrock’s alienation not through dramatic events but through the small, repetitive aspects of urban life that he fixates upon. The “pipes” suggest an industrialised landscape, a modern setting where Prufrock’s identity is dissolved within the mundanity of everyday observations. This image encapsulates the Modernist ethos of disillusionment; Prufrock’s life, like the smoke, seems to dissipate without leaving a lasting trace, reinforcing his dread of a life spent in obscurity and passivity.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line78" style="display:none;">
    <p>This line depicts a tableau of “lonely men” isolated in their own domestic spaces, leaning out of windows as if seeking something beyond the confines of their lives. The phrase “shirt-sleeves” conveys a sense of casualness or mundanity, contrasting with the profound loneliness that Prufrock sees in these figures. The image reflects social atomisation, where individuals are physically proximate yet emotionally and existentially isolated, a theme central to Modernist literature. By observing these men, Prufrock recognises a shared experience of alienation, yet he remains detached, unable to bridge the gap of empathy or solidarity. Eliot’s use of this line as an ekphrastic reflection captures Prufrock’s identification with these lonely figures, as they embody his own existential plight. The act of “leaning out of windows” symbolises a yearning for connection or escape, yet it is passive and ultimately unfulfilled, reinforcing Prufrock’s view of modern life as fragmented and devoid of intimacy.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line79" style="display:none;">
    <p>In this powerful line, Prufrock imagines himself as “a pair of ragged claws,” projecting a deeply nihilistic vision of himself as a lowly, animalistic creature. The claws, “ragged” and devoid of humanity, signify Prufrock’s perception of himself as base, insignificant, and fundamentally disconnected from society. This line captures his ontological abjection, as he imagines retreating into a form that requires no social engagement or emotional vulnerability. Eliot’s use of zoomorphic imagery reduces Prufrock to something less than human, reflecting his self-contempt and his yearning to escape the burdens of human consciousness. The choice of “ragged” suggests decay and ruin, embodying Prufrock’s sense of spiritual and psychological deterioration. This line encapsulates the Modernist disenchantment with human existence; rather than aspiring to human connection or enlightenment, Prufrock longs for the simplicity of an animal existence, free from the complexities and anxieties of modern life.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line80" style="display:none;">
    <p>The image of “scuttling across the floors of silent seas” reinforces Prufrock’s desire for retreat and insignificance. The verb “scuttling” conveys a sense of hurried, furtive movement, as if Prufrock wishes to disappear, unnoticed, beneath the surface. The “silent seas” evoke a vast, indifferent void, symbolising the cosmic isolation that Prufrock feels; he envisions himself submerged in a world of silence and darkness, far removed from human interaction. Eliot’s use of subaqueous imagery here reflects Prufrock’s yearning to escape societal scrutiny and enter a state of oblivion, where he can avoid judgment and self-consciousness. This line also captures the existential abyss at the core of Prufrock’s character; he sees himself as a creature skittering in a barren, lifeless landscape, detached from any sense of purpose or connection. Through this image, Eliot articulates the Modernist alienation from nature and humanity, as Prufrock’s fantasies of freedom are steeped in despair, and he seeks solace in a metaphorical descent into nothingness.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line81" style="display:none;">
    <p>Eliot’s description of the “afternoon, the evening” as sleeping “so peacefully” provides a momentary shift in tone, yet this peace is laden with irony. The tranquillity of the scene stands in stark contrast to Prufrock’s inner turmoil, highlighting the dissonance between internal and external worlds. The personification of time as “sleeping” suggests a suspension or pause, but for Prufrock, this peacefulness reflects stagnation rather than solace. This line captures the Modernist theme of ennui, as the stillness of the scene mirrors Prufrock’s own inability to engage with life. The ironic pastoral—a peaceful exterior masking an anxious soul—reinforces Prufrock’s sense of disconnection from his surroundings. Eliot’s use of this image creates an atmosphere of existential inertia, as the sleeping afternoon and evening signify a world that remains indifferent to Prufrock’s struggles, reinforcing his sense of solitude and isolation.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line82" style="display:none;">
    <p>The image of “long fingers” smoothing the afternoon and evening is enigmatic, suggesting an external force that calms or suppresses time. These “long fingers” could symbolise a force of resignation or conformity that erodes Prufrock’s sense of urgency, allowing him to continue delaying action. The anthropomorphic image implies that Prufrock’s life is being manipulated or controlled by forces beyond his understanding, echoing the deterministic undertones of Modernist literature, where individuals feel powerless against the forces shaping their existence. The fingers could represent societal expectations or the inexorable passage of time, both of which smooth over Prufrock’s aspirations, leaving him inert. Eliot’s use of this image captures Prufrock’s psychological fatalism; he is lulled into complacency by forces he cannot identify or resist, reinforcing his passive surrender to the drift of his life. This line conveys a sense of existential sedation, as Prufrock feels soothed yet also trapped by the smoothing effect of time.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line83" style="display:none;">
    <p>The progression from “asleep” to “tired” and finally to “malingers” captures a descent from natural rest to something more insidious and unhealthy. To “malinger” is to feign illness or avoid duty, suggesting that Prufrock’s passivity is not merely a result of fatigue but an intentional evasion. This line epitomises existential procrastination; Prufrock’s stasis is less about peace and more about avoidance, as he languishes in a self-imposed limbo. The ellipses convey a drawn-out, lethargic tempo, emphasising the slow, inevitable decline of his motivation and energy. Eliot’s choice of the word “malingers” implies that Prufrock’s inertia is deliberate, a manifestation of his fear of facing life’s demands. This line captures the nihilistic undertow of Modernist thought, where inactivity becomes a refuge from the overwhelming pressures of existence. Prufrock’s malaise reflects his ontological withdrawal, as he avoids engaging with life by retreating into a lethargy that is both comforting and corrosive.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line84" style="display:none;">
    <p>This line presents an intimate yet ambiguous image, where “the evening” or “the moment” is imagined as something physically stretched out “beside you and me.” The phrase “stretched on the floor” evokes a sense of physical exhaustion or surrender, as though time itself has collapsed, mirroring Prufrock’s inner weariness. By placing this presence “beside you and me,” Eliot momentarily collapses the distance between Prufrock and the reader (or his imagined companion), invoking a brief sense of companionship. However, this closeness is imbued with existential irony; despite the proximity, Prufrock remains emotionally and psychologically isolated. The phrase “here beside you and me” offers a feigned intimacy that underscores his underlying solitude, as the addressee remains elusive and abstract. Eliot’s use of corporeal metaphor for time—implying that it, too, can lie exhausted on the floor—captures Prufrock’s sense of a stifling, omnipresent inertia. This line exemplifies the Modernist preoccupation with temporal malaise, as Prufrock experiences time not as a dynamic force but as something limp and fatigued, drained of vitality and momentum.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line85" style="display:none;">
    <p>Prufrock’s mention of “tea and cakes and ices” evokes the superficiality and banality of social rituals, emphasising the triviality of the decisions that dominate his life. The accumulation of items related to dining reflects the polite and genteel aspects of upper-class social settings, yet they are framed here as an insubstantial preamble to something more significant that Prufrock cannot bring himself to confront. Eliot’s use of culinary metonymy captures the artificiality and vacuity of social interactions, where connection is reduced to ritualised gestures devoid of real emotional depth. This line exemplifies societal ennui; Prufrock’s life is governed by repetitive, socially mandated activities that provide neither fulfilment nor purpose. The line also reflects bourgeois inertia, as Prufrock remains entrenched in a routine of empty formalities that prevent him from engaging with the existential questions he so fears. Through this image, Eliot critiques the complacency of modern life, where self-exploration is perpetually deferred by the comfortable distractions of social convention.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line86" style="display:none;">
    <p>Here, Prufrock contemplates whether he has the “strength” to provoke a transformative moment, to bring his life to a climactic decision or revelation. The word “force” implies that such a moment would require active effort and confrontation, elements that are antithetical to Prufrock’s habitual passivity. This line reflects existential impotence; Prufrock yearns for change yet doubts his own capability to enact it, as though even a crisis is beyond his reach. Eliot’s choice of the term “crisis” introduces a sense of potential upheaval, a turning point that could break the cycle of his inaction. However, Prufrock’s rhetorical question underscores his psychological frailty; he fears that he lacks the fortitude to embrace change, even if it might lead to self-discovery. This line epitomises the Modernist tension between action and paralysis, as Prufrock’s aspirations are thwarted by his own self-doubt. The phrase “force the moment” captures his ontological inertia; he recognises the need for decisive action but remains immobilised by his insecurities, reinforcing his deep-seated existential stagnation.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line87" style="display:none;">
    <p>This line reveals a darker aspect of Prufrock’s psyche, as he describes acts of asceticism and penitence—“wept and fasted, wept and prayed”—that suggest an internalised guilt or shame. The liturgical repetition of “wept” reflects a ritualistic suffering, as though Prufrock has undergone his own private penance without achieving any spiritual or emotional release. This line hints at spiritual desolation; despite his attempts at self-purification, he remains haunted by his inadequacies and failures. The acts of weeping and fasting are typically associated with religious fervour, yet here they seem hollow, merely emphasising his psychological masochism. Eliot uses this line to explore psychomachia, the internal conflict between Prufrock’s desire for transcendence and his awareness of his own unworthiness. Prufrock’s suffering is self-inflicted, stemming from a profound alienation from both society and himself. This line encapsulates the Modernist exploration of psychological torment, where traditional rituals of atonement are rendered futile in a world that has lost its moral and spiritual coherence.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line88" style="display:none;">
    <p>In this line, Prufrock makes a self-deprecating allusion to the Biblical story of John the Baptist, whose head was brought on a platter at the request of Salome. By imagining his own head on a platter, Prufrock indulges in a morbid fantasy of his own sacrifice or humiliation, yet he undercuts it with the comic detail of his “slightly bald” head. This image encapsulates self-effacing martyrdom; he envisions himself as a tragic figure but lacks the gravitas or heroism to make the fantasy resonate. The baldness reinforces his sense of physical inadequacy and ageing, intensifying his fear of being found lacking. Eliot’s use of grotesque irony here serves to mock Prufrock’s pretensions of martyrdom, as he compares his trivial insecurities to a grand narrative of religious sacrifice. This line exemplifies the anti-heroic undertones of Modernist literature, where the protagonist’s inner life is filled with grandiose images that are deflated by self-doubt and irony. Prufrock’s vision of himself as John the Baptist reflects his need to frame his insecurities within a larger narrative, even as he recognises the absurdity of this comparison.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line89" style="display:none;">
    <p>Prufrock’s admission that he is “no prophet” undercuts any lingering sense of importance or destiny in his life, reflecting his awareness of his own ordinariness. The phrase “and here’s no great matter” dismisses his struggles as insignificant, revealing a profound sense of ontological disenfranchisement; he lacks the conviction or purpose that might lend meaning to his existence. By denying his role as a prophet, Prufrock rejects any possibility of influence or wisdom, reinforcing his existential marginality. This line captures the Modernist preoccupation with self-effacement, where individuals are acutely aware of their own insignificance in a disenchanted world. Eliot’s use of anti-heroic self-deprecation reflects Prufrock’s alienation from both society and from traditional narratives of purpose and identity. The dismissal of his life as “no great matter” epitomises the cosmic insignificance that characterises Modernist literature, where the individual is reduced to a fleeting, inconsequential presence in an indifferent universe.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line90" style="display:none;">
    <p>This line reveals Prufrock’s awareness of his own missed potential, as he imagines his “moment of greatness” as something that has “flicker[ed],” briefly visible before vanishing. The metaphor of a “flicker” conveys the transitory nature of his aspirations, suggesting that any chance for self-fulfilment has been lost in a fleeting instant. This moment of self-reflection captures Prufrock’s existential regret; he recognises that he has allowed opportunities to pass him by, leaving him with only a faint, fading memory of what might have been. Eliot’s use of visual ephemerality here symbolises the fragility of human ambition in the face of self-doubt and fear. The line exemplifies Modernist themes of disenchantment and deferred potential, as Prufrock’s dreams are reduced to brief, impotent flashes. By framing his greatness as a “flicker,” Prufrock reveals the entropy of aspiration in a world where ideals and achievements are inevitably consumed by the forces of doubt and decay.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line91" style="display:none;">
    <p>In this line, Prufrock imagines Death as an “eternal Footman” who waits to escort him to the afterlife, symbolising his mortality anxiety and his sense of being mocked by fate. The “snicker” of the Footman suggests that Death views Prufrock’s life as trivial, reinforcing his fear that his existence lacks meaning or dignity. Eliot’s personification of Death as a servile but dismissive figure conveys a sense of ironic detachment, as though the ultimate end of life is simply a routine duty for the Footman. This image captures Prufrock’s existential nihilism, as he perceives his death not as a profound event but as a moment met with indifference and quiet scorn. The “snicker” embodies cosmic derision; Prufrock fears that the universe itself mocks his unfulfilled life. Eliot uses this line to highlight the absurdity of human aspiration in the face of mortality, as Prufrock realises that his life’s struggles and fears will end in a moment of dismissive finality.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line92" style="display:none;">
    <p>This admission of fear is one of Prufrock’s most direct and vulnerable statements, encapsulating the root of his inaction and existential paralysis. The phrase “in short” suggests that, after all his lengthy introspection, his hesitation boils down to a simple, unadorned fear. This line captures Prufrock’s ontological dread; he is paralysed by an unnamed terror that prevents him from engaging fully with life. Eliot’s use of minimalistic language here contrasts with the elaborate imagery of previous lines, stripping Prufrock’s experience down to its raw essence. This line reveals the Modernist fascination with internalised anxiety; Prufrock’s entire monologue, with its evasions and digressions, is ultimately an attempt to grapple with a profound, pervasive fear. By admitting “I was afraid,” Prufrock exposes his core vulnerability, his recognition that his life has been governed not by circumstance but by his own limitations. This line captures the existential vacuum at the heart of Prufrock’s character, as his identity is shaped not by action or belief but by a persistent, paralysing fear.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line93" style="display:none;">
    <p>Prufrock’s question—“would it have been worth it”—reintroduces his endless cycle of self-doubt, as he contemplates whether any action or risk would have justified the potential for failure or rejection. The phrase “after all” implies a sense of retrospection and resignation, suggesting that Prufrock is no longer certain of the value of even hypothetical experiences. This line captures his existential ambivalence, as he vacillates between a desire for meaningful engagement and the pervasive belief that such efforts would ultimately prove futile. Eliot’s hypothetical phrasing reflects the Modernist preoccupation with counterfactual contemplation, where characters dwell on missed opportunities and imagine alternate lives that they will never realise. Prufrock’s question encapsulates his sense of futility; he is haunted by the possibility that, even if he had dared to act, the rewards would have been insubstantial. This line highlights the epistemic uncertainty that defines Prufrock’s worldview, as he is unable to affirm or deny the value of experience, trapped in an endless loop of hypothetical regret.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line94" style="display:none;">
    <p>Prufrock’s list of “cups, marmalade, [and] tea” invokes the banality of polite society, reducing life’s moments to domestic rituals that seem shallow and repetitive. The enumeration of these trivial items reinforces the insignificance of his daily routine, suggesting that his life has been consumed by superficial gestures rather than meaningful experiences. Eliot’s use of culinary imagery captures the vacuity of bourgeois existence, where social interactions are governed by ritual rather than authenticity. This line exemplifies Modernist critiques of societal conformity, as Prufrock’s life is defined by the empty formalities of his social class. The mention of such mundane objects highlights his sense of existential disenchantment, as he recognises that his life’s trajectory has been guided by habits rather than genuine desires. This line underscores Prufrock’s alienation from himself, as his identity has been subsumed by the routine comforts of a society that values appearances over substance.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line95" style="display:none;">
    <p>In this line, Eliot juxtaposes the delicacy of “porcelain” with the superficiality of “some talk of you and me,” emphasising the fragility and emptiness of social interactions. The “porcelain” evokes a sense of refinement and decorum, but it is also cold and brittle, symbolising the tenuousness of Prufrock’s connections with others. The repeated “among” creates a palindromic structure that mirrors Prufrock’s sense of entrapment within these vacuous settings, circling endlessly within the bounds of polite society. Eliot uses material imagery to convey Prufrock’s feeling of alienation, as the “porcelain” represents a social decorum that is both beautiful and suffocating. This line reflects bourgeois insularity; Prufrock’s life is defined by carefully controlled environments where genuine emotions are stifled in favour of formalities. The phrase “some talk of you and me” highlights the insincerity and performativity of social discourse, as conversations remain shallow and devoid of true intimacy. This line underscores the Modernist critique of social facades, where relationships are reduced to empty words, constrained by the unyielding expectations of propriety.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line96" style="display:none;">
    <p>This recurring question, “Would it have been worth while,” embodies Prufrock’s profound existential indecision. The phrase reflects a hesitant retrospective longing; he is haunted by the idea that his inaction may have robbed him of something valuable, yet he remains uncertain whether the potential rewards of taking risks would have justified the emotional cost. Eliot’s use of this line conveys teleological doubt, as Prufrock is unable to determine whether any actions or relationships have inherent worth. This line encapsulates ontological ambivalence, as he questions the significance of his existence and the decisions he has—or hasn’t—made. By framing this question without resolution, Eliot underscores the epistemic uncertainty that pervades Prufrock’s worldview, where every hypothetical scenario is met with the same irresolvable doubt. Prufrock’s question reflects the existential vacillation that defines his character, as he remains caught between the fear of regret and the fear of rejection, ultimately paralysed by both.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line97" style="display:none;">
    <p>The metaphor “to have bitten off the matter with a smile” suggests a bold, assertive approach to life—something Prufrock finds utterly foreign. The phrase evokes a sense of confidence, as though the “matter” of life or love could be taken in a single bite and easily digested. This image contrasts sharply with Prufrock’s own cautious and inhibited disposition, highlighting his deep-seated fear of confrontation. Eliot’s use of gustatory metaphor conveys Prufrock’s envy of those who can tackle life’s challenges with ease, underscoring his own feelings of inadequacy. This line captures Prufrock’s existential timidity; he is unable to “bite off” or seize the essence of life, always holding back for fear of failure or ridicule. The addition of “with a smile” implies a nonchalance or charm that Prufrock feels he lacks, reflecting his social insecurity and sense of inferiority. This line crystallises the Modernist anxiety over self-assertion, as Prufrock envies those who engage fully with life while he remains on the periphery, paralysed by self-doubt.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line98" style="display:none;">
    <p>In this line, Prufrock imagines “squeezing the universe into a ball,” an image that conveys a sense of audacity and omnipotence, yet remains entirely hypothetical. This grandiose metaphor hints at Prufrock’s unfulfilled potential and his yearning for a life of power and influence. The idea of “squeezing” suggests both control and compression, as if Prufrock longs to reduce the vast complexities of existence into something manageable and contained. Eliot’s use of cosmic compression here reflects Prufrock’s desire for agency, yet the sheer improbability of the image reveals his awareness of his own limitations. This line captures the aspirational futility that defines Prufrock’s character, as he entertains dreams of dominance over the universe while remaining acutely aware of his impotence. The “universe” represents the overwhelming scope of life’s possibilities, which Prufrock feels unable to grasp or engage with. This line exemplifies the Modernist disillusionment with idealism, as Prufrock’s grand visions are tempered by a resigned acknowledgment of his own insignificance.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line99" style="display:none;">
    <p>The act of “rolling” the universe towards an “overwhelming question” suggests a deliberate approach to confronting life’s fundamental mysteries, yet it remains a fantasy. The word “overwhelming” captures Prufrock’s fear of existential inquiry, as if the mere act of seeking answers could be devastating. Eliot’s use of kinetic imagery implies movement and purpose, but the hypothetical nature of this line reveals Prufrock’s reluctance to engage with life’s challenges. The “overwhelming question” symbolises the unanswered existential riddle that haunts him—a question about meaning, purpose, or identity that he feels ill-equipped to face. This line reflects ontological vertigo, as Prufrock is daunted by the vast unknowns of existence. By imagining himself “rolling” the universe towards this question, Prufrock envisions a decisive act that he knows he will never perform, reinforcing his existential procrastination. Eliot uses this line to highlight Prufrock’s deep ambivalence; he yearns to confront life’s mysteries but remains immobilised by the fear of what he might find.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line100" style="display:none;">
    <p>Prufrock’s imagined declaration, “I am Lazarus, come from the dead,” is a Biblical allusion to the story of Lazarus, who was resurrected by Jesus. By envisioning himself as Lazarus, Prufrock fantasises about a return from the dead, symbolising a profound transformation or revelation. This line captures his desire for spiritual rebirth and a second chance to confront life with renewed courage. However, the grandiosity of this vision contrasts sharply with Prufrock’s actual timidity, highlighting the disparity between aspiration and reality. Eliot’s use of soteriological imagery reflects Prufrock’s yearning for redemption, as though he wishes to escape the figurative “death” of his current, unfulfilled existence. Yet, this fantasy is steeped in irony; Prufrock knows he lacks the conviction or courage to make such a declaration in reality. This line underscores the Modernist theme of existential resurrection—the longing to break free from the paralysis of self-doubt and embrace a more authentic self, a transformation Prufrock is tragically unable to realise.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line101" style="display:none;">
    <p>This line extends the Lazarus metaphor, as Prufrock imagines himself returning with revelations, ready to “tell you all.” The repetition of “tell you all” implies a desire for confession, an urge to disclose the hidden fears and insecurities that have kept him isolated. Eliot’s use of repetitive syntax reflects Prufrock’s obsession with unburdening himself, suggesting that his silence has weighed on him like an unspoken confession. However, the hypothetical nature of this statement reinforces the performative irony of his internal monologue; Prufrock knows he will never actually share his thoughts with anyone. This line captures his repressed communicative impulse; he yearns to articulate his inner life but remains paralysed by the fear of vulnerability and rejection. The phrase “I shall tell you all” reflects the Modernist theme of internalised confession, where characters struggle with an intense need to be understood yet are incapable of externalising their truths. For Prufrock, the act of confession remains an unattainable fantasy, mirroring his deeper inability to engage with life.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line102" style="display:none;">
    <p>Prufrock’s imagined confession is abruptly undercut by the thought that his listener might respond with indifference or misunderstanding, represented by the woman’s dismissal: “That is not what I meant at all.” This line captures Prufrock’s hermeneutic anxiety—a fear that his words and intentions will be misinterpreted or disregarded. The act of “settling a pillow by her head” conveys a sense of domestic intimacy, yet it only amplifies Prufrock’s dread of emotional exposure. Eliot’s use of banal domestic imagery juxtaposed with existential dread encapsulates the Modernist tension between everyday life and the profound alienation within. The phrase “That is not what I meant at all” reflects the failure of interpersonal understanding, a recurring theme in Modernist literature, where attempts at connection are frequently thwarted by miscommunication. For Prufrock, the fear of being misunderstood reinforces his isolation, as he imagines even his most honest confessions being met with indifference or misinterpretation. This line encapsulates Prufrock’s ontological solipsism; he is trapped within his own mind, unable to trust that his intentions will ever be truly comprehended.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line103" style="display:none;">
    <p>This line repeats the sentiment of the previous one, reinforcing Prufrock’s fear of irretrievable misunderstanding. The emphatic “at all” underscores the finality of this rejection, as though even the slightest possibility of mutual understanding is foreclosed. This refrain-like line captures radical hermeneutic failure—the inability to communicate meaning across the chasm of individual experience. Eliot’s use of minimalistic repetition reinforces Prufrock’s sense of futility in seeking connection; he is certain that his words, however sincere, will fail to resonate. This line reflects the Modernist crisis of communication, where the gap between self and other becomes insurmountable, leaving characters trapped in their own subjective realities. For Prufrock, this imagined rejection encapsulates his deepest fears: that his attempts at authenticity will not only fail but will highlight the very isolation he longs to escape. The repetition of this sentiment mirrors the existential futility that pervades Prufrock’s life, as his desire to connect is met with the inevitability of misunderstanding.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line104" style="display:none;">
    <p>In a moment of self-awareness, Prufrock dismisses any pretensions to grandeur by asserting, “I am not Prince Hamlet.” By referencing Hamlet, the archetype of the indecisive intellectual, Prufrock implicitly aligns himself with Hamlet’s introspective paralysis but rejects the notion that he possesses Hamlet’s tragic importance. This line captures Prufrock’s anti-heroic self-conception; he views himself not as a tragic figure but as a marginal character in his own life. Eliot’s use of literary allusion here reflects Prufrock’s recognition of his own existential inconsequence. Unlike Hamlet, who grapples with profound moral dilemmas, Prufrock’s struggles are marked by triviality and self-doubt. This line exemplifies Modernist anti-idealism, where the protagonist lacks the conviction and centrality of classical heroes. Prufrock’s admission that he was “not meant to be” Hamlet reveals his sense of ontological insignificance, as he accepts his role as a passive observer rather than an active participant in life’s drama. This line encapsulates the Modernist disenchantment with heroism, as Prufrock acknowledges his inability to rise to the stature of a tragic protagonist.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line105" style="display:none;">
    <p>Prufrock continues his self-dismissal by identifying himself as an “attendant lord,” a secondary character whose purpose is to “swell a progress” or provide background to someone else’s story. This line captures Prufrock’s sense of existential marginality; he sees himself as a minor figure in the lives of others, devoid of agency or importance. The phrase “one that will do” suggests a resigned acceptance of mediocrity, as Prufrock feels that his presence is only passably adequate, lacking any unique or defining significance. Eliot’s use of self-effacing epithets reflects Prufrock’s internalised belief that he is unworthy of a central role in life. This line encapsulates the Modernist critique of the individual’s role in a fragmented society, where personal identity is subsumed by the collective narrative. By framing himself as an “attendant lord,” Prufrock reveals his deep-seated self-abnegation, as he resigns himself to a life on the periphery, unable to assert his own narrative amidst the larger, impersonal forces of modern life.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line106" style="display:none;">
    <p>Prufrock’s self-description as one who might “advise the prince” yet be merely “an easy tool” underscores his perception of himself as both dispensable and manipulable. The term “easy tool” reflects Prufrock’s sense of instrumentalisation—he sees himself as someone used by others for convenience rather than for any intrinsic value. The choice of “advise the prince” suggests an illusion of influence, yet Prufrock recognises that he would ultimately lack any true authority or impact. Eliot uses servile imagery to portray Prufrock’s internalised inferiority; he views himself as a subordinate whose voice is incidental rather than essential. This line captures the Modernist theme of self-effacement, where the individual feels diminished in the face of larger, more dominant figures or ideals. Prufrock’s acceptance of his role as a mere “tool” reflects his existential compliance, as he resigns himself to being shaped and used by the demands of others rather than asserting his own identity.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line107" style="display:none;">
    <p>Here, Prufrock describes himself as “deferential” and “glad to be of use,” highlighting his self-imposed subservience and eagerness to please. The term “deferential” implies a tendency to yield to others, while “glad to be of use” suggests that he derives his sense of worth from fulfilling others’ expectations. This line captures Prufrock’s servility complex; he finds comfort in submission, embracing a role that absolves him of responsibility for his own life. Eliot’s use of self-diminishing language reflects Prufrock’s surrender to social conformity, as he chooses to define himself through the approval and utility he offers to others. This line reveals Prufrock’s dispositional humility, yet this humility is undercut by a profound sense of self-abandonment, as he willingly erases his own desires to conform to external demands. The line underscores the Modernist critique of self-negation; Prufrock’s deference is not virtuous, but a symptom of his existential fear of asserting his true self.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line108" style="display:none;">
    <p>In this line, Prufrock characterises himself as “politic, cautious, and meticulous,” reinforcing his inclination toward overthinking and hyper-awareness. Each adjective conveys a layer of Prufrock’s deliberative paralysis—“politic” suggests a desire to avoid confrontation, “cautious” implies fear-driven hesitation, and “meticulous” denotes an obsessive focus on detail that prevents decisive action. Eliot’s use of constrained diction reflects Prufrock’s compulsive need for control, yet this need only stifles his ability to engage freely with the world. The line exemplifies methodical self-restraint, as Prufrock’s overly careful disposition renders him incapable of spontaneity or authenticity. Through these descriptors, Eliot captures the psychological rigidity that pervades Prufrock’s personality, painting him as a figure ensnared by his own meticulousness. The qualities that he believes lend him prudence actually entrap him in a cycle of self-conscious inaction, epitomising the Modernist portrayal of hypercivilised self-consciousness.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line109" style="display:none;">
    <p>Here, Prufrock presents himself as “full of high sentence,” suggesting a superficial eloquence or pretentiousness, tempered by his admission of being “a bit obtuse.” The phrase “high sentence” implies a capacity for lofty language or philosophical musing, yet “obtuse” reveals his awareness of his own intellectual shortcomings. This line captures Prufrock’s pseudo-intellectualism; he values the appearance of intelligence but recognises his lack of genuine insight. Eliot’s use of self-critical oxymoron reflects Prufrock’s contradictory nature, as he simultaneously exalts and undercuts his intellectual faculties. This line exemplifies self-conscious mediocrity, as Prufrock sees himself as a person of half-formed thoughts and unfulfilled intellectual potential. His admission of obtuseness suggests a self-awareness that is both painful and paralysing, reinforcing his epistemological insecurity. Through this line, Eliot critiques the Modernist struggle with identity and intelligence, as Prufrock’s grand ideas and philosophies are diluted by his inability to translate them into meaningful action or understanding.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line110" style="display:none;">
    <p>In this self-deprecating admission, Prufrock reveals that he sees himself as “almost ridiculous” and “almost…the Fool,” acknowledging his fear of social embarrassment. The repetition of “almost” underscores his ambivalence, as he hovers on the edge of self-disdain without fully committing to it. By describing himself as “the Fool,” Prufrock invokes the Shakespearean archetype of the court jester—an ironic, insightful character often relegated to the margins. Eliot’s use of self-mocking diction captures Prufrock’s internalised shame, as he is acutely aware of his own perceived absurdity. This line reflects tragicomic self-awareness; Prufrock is painfully conscious of the incongruity between his desires and his actions, yet he remains trapped in this state of unfulfilled yearning. The image of “the Fool” evokes existential irony; Prufrock recognises his role as an outsider, both within society and within his own mind. Through this admission, Eliot explores the Modernist theme of self-alienation, where individuals become caricatures of themselves, unable to reconcile their inner worlds with external expectations.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line111" style="display:none;">
    <p>This line captures Prufrock’s acute awareness of his own mortality, as he repeats “I grow old” in a melancholic, almost resigned tone. The repetition conveys a sense of inevitability, as though aging itself is an affliction that Prufrock is powerless to resist. Eliot’s use of existential refrain here reflects Prufrock’s despair at the passage of time, underscoring the ontological fatigue that defines his outlook. This line epitomises temporal disillusionment; Prufrock experiences his own aging not as a process of growth but as a gradual surrender to decay. The ellipses suggest a trailing off, a sense of something unfinished, capturing Prufrock’s reluctance to confront the implications of his aging. Through this line, Eliot illustrates the Modernist anxiety over mortality, where the inevitable approach of death renders life’s trivialities hollow and unfulfilling. For Prufrock, the repetition of “I grow old” serves as a grim reminder of his unaccomplished aspirations and the relentless erosion of time.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line112" style="display:none;">
    <p>In this line, Prufrock envisions himself adopting a trivial, almost affected habit—wearing his trousers rolled—signifying his resignation to superficial gestures as he ages. The act of rolling his trousers suggests a deliberate, somewhat foppish concern with appearance, indicating his concession to a performative version of himself as an elderly figure. Eliot’s use of idiosyncratic imagery here reflects Prufrock’s embrace of absurdity, as he contemplates a superficial rebellion against the conventions of age. This line captures decadent affectation; rather than confront his fear of aging with dignity, Prufrock chooses to trivialise it, adopting a whimsical stance. The phrase “bottoms of my trousers” evokes an image of conformity to societal expectations even in small acts of rebellion, as Prufrock remains bound by appearance over substance. This line exemplifies Modernist self-parody, where the protagonist adopts eccentric behaviours as a way of coping with deeper insecurities and fears about identity and purpose.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line113" style="display:none;">
    <p>Prufrock’s question about whether to “part [his] hair behind” and “dare to eat a peach” captures his fixation on minor, trivial decisions, reflecting his fear of appearing foolish or vulnerable. The phrase “do I dare to eat a peach” is laden with innuendo, symbolising both sensuality and the fear of indulging in life’s pleasures. Eliot’s use of bathetic interrogation transforms these mundane questions into symbols of Prufrock’s existential hesitation; even the simplest pleasures are fraught with anxiety. This line exemplifies hyper-self-consciousness, as Prufrock obsesses over actions that most people would take for granted. The peach, in particular, symbolises hedonic apprehension; it represents the sweetness of life that Prufrock feels unable to enjoy without fear of embarrassment or failure. By contemplating such trivial choices, Prufrock underscores the absurdity of his own indecision, as he reduces life to a series of inconsequential acts. This line encapsulates the Modernist theme of existential absurdity, where individuals become paralysed by the weight of their own self-awareness.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line114" style="display:none;">
    <p>Prufrock’s fantasy of wearing “white flannel trousers” and walking on the beach suggests a yearning for freedom and a life less constrained by societal norms. The white trousers evoke a sense of innocence or purity, as though Prufrock longs for a return to a simpler, more authentic self. However, the specificity of “white flannel trousers” implies an almost absurd attention to detail, revealing his inability to escape his obsessive concern with appearance. Eliot’s use of idyllic imagery here captures Prufrock’s longing for a more liberated existence, yet his vision is tinged with irony, as his aspirations remain confined within aesthetic choices. This line reflects nostalgic idealism; Prufrock romanticises the notion of a carefree life, even as he recognises its unattainability. By imagining himself on the beach, Prufrock evokes the liminality of the shoreline—a place between land and sea, symbolising his existence on the threshold of change but never fully crossing over. This line illustrates the Modernist ambivalence toward liberation, where desires for freedom are tempered by self-imposed limitations.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line115" style="display:none;">
    <p>The image of “mermaids singing, each to each” introduces a mythical element, symbolising beauty, allure, and the unattainable. The mermaids represent the sensual and enchanting aspects of life that Prufrock feels forever cut off from; they sing “each to each,” suggesting an exclusive, self-contained world that he cannot access. Eliot’s use of mythopoetic imagery reflects Prufrock’s sense of being an outsider, drawn to but eternally distanced from the mysteries of desire and beauty. This line captures erotic exclusion; Prufrock feels unworthy of the mermaids’ attention, resigned to observing from afar. The reference to mermaids underscores the Modernist theme of unrequited desire, as Prufrock’s fantasies of intimacy and connection remain elusive. The mermaids’ song is seductive, yet their lack of attention to him reinforces his alienation from enchantment; he is trapped in a mundane reality, unable to partake in the beauty and mystery he so desperately yearns for. This line encapsulates Prufrock’s self-imposed exile from fulfilment, as he resigns himself to a life devoid of passion or wonder.
</p>
</div>
<div id="line116" style="display:none;">
    <p>Prufrock’s admission, “I do not think that they will sing to me,” acknowledges his belief in his own unworthiness and irrelevance. He anticipates rejection, convinced that he is invisible to the beauty and enchantment represented by the mermaids. Eliot’s use of melancholic foreboding captures Prufrock’s pre-emptive disillusionment, as he resigns himself to perpetual exclusion from the spheres of pleasure and connection. This line exemplifies self-fulfilling defeatism; by assuming he is unworthy, Prufrock ensures that he will remain isolated. The phrase “they will not sing to me” reflects his ontological marginalisation, as he perceives himself as an outcast from life’s pleasures. This line highlights the Modernist exploration of self-rejection, where characters internalise societal judgments and exclude themselves from opportunities for fulfilment. For Prufrock, the mermaids’ silence symbolises the inaccessibility of his own desires, reinforcing his belief that he is fundamentally separate from the world of passion and beauty he admires.
